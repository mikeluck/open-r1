"Define a sequence recursively by $t_1 = 20$ , $t_2 = 21$ , and \[t_n = \frac{5t_{n-1}+1}{25t_{n-2}}\] for all $n \ge 3$ . Then $t_{2020}$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$ , where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$ .",626,"Solution:
The sequence is defined by $t_1 = 20$, $t_2 = 21$, and $t_n = \frac{5t_{n-1}+1}{25t_{n-2}}$ for $n \ge 3$.
We compute the first few terms of the sequence:
$t_1 = 20$
$t_2 = 21$
$t_3 = \frac{5(21)+1}{25(20)} = \frac{106}{500} = \frac{53}{250}$
$t_4 = \frac{5(\frac{53}{250})+1}{25(21)} = \frac{\frac{53}{50}+1}{525} = \frac{\frac{103}{50}}{525} = \frac{103}{26250}$
$t_5 = \frac{5(\frac{103}{26250})+1}{25(\frac{53}{250})} = \frac{\frac{515}{26250}+1}{\frac{53}{10}} = \frac{\frac{26765}{26250}}{\frac{53}{10}} = \frac{26765}{26250} \times \frac{10}{53} = \frac{505}{2625} = \frac{101}{525}$
$t_6 = \frac{5(\frac{101}{525})+1}{25(\frac{103}{26250})} = \frac{\frac{101}{105}+1}{\frac{103}{1050}} = \frac{\frac{206}{105}}{\frac{103}{1050}} = \frac{206}{105} \times \frac{1050}{103} = 20$
$t_7 = \frac{5(20)+1}{25(\frac{101}{525})} = \frac{101}{\frac{25 \times 101}{525}} = \frac{101}{\frac{101}{21}} = 21$

Since $t_6 = t_1$ and $t_7 = t_2$, the sequence is periodic with a period of $7-1 = 6-1 = 5$. The terms repeat every 5 steps.
We need to find $t_{2020}$. Since the period is 5, we consider the index modulo 5.
$2020 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$.
When the index is a multiple of 5, the term is the 5th term of the cycle.
$t_{2020} = t_5 = \frac{101}{525}$.

We are given that $t_{2020} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.
Comparing with $t_{2020} = \frac{101}{525}$, we have $p = 101$ and $q = 525$.
We check if $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime. $101$ is a prime number. $525 = 3 \times 5^2 \times 7$. Since $101$ is not a factor of $525$, $\gcd(101, 525) = 1$.

We need to find $p+q$.
$p+q = 101 + 525 = 626$.

Let $x$ and $y$ be real numbers satisfying $x^4y^5+y^4x^5=810$ and $x^3y^6+y^3x^6=945$ . Evaluate $2x^3+(xy)^3+2y^3$ .,89,"Solution:
Let the given equations be
1. $x^4y^5+y^4x^5=810 \implies (xy)^4(x+y)=810$
2. $x^3y^6+y^3x^6=945 \implies (xy)^3(x^3+y^3)=945$

Let $P = xy$ and $S = x+y$. The equations become:
1. $P^4 S = 810$
2. $P^3 (S(S^2-3P)) = 945 \implies P^3 S(S^2-3P) = 945$

Dividing equation 2 by equation 1:
$\frac{P^3 S(S^2-3P)}{P^4 S} = \frac{945}{810} = \frac{7}{6}$
$\frac{S^2-3P}{P} = \frac{7}{6}$
$\frac{S^2}{P} - 3 = \frac{7}{6}$
$\frac{S^2}{P} = \frac{7}{6} + 3 = \frac{7+18}{6} = \frac{25}{6}$
$6S^2 = 25P \implies P = \frac{6S^2}{25}$

Substitute $P$ into equation 1:
$\left(\frac{6S^2}{25}\right)^4 S = 810$
$\frac{6^4 S^8}{25^4} S = 810$
$S^9 = 810 \cdot \frac{25^4}{6^4} = 810 \cdot \left(\frac{25}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{5^9}{8}$
$S = \frac{5}{\sqrt[9]{8}} = \frac{5}{2^{1/3}}$

The expression to evaluate is $2x^3+(xy)^3+2y^3 = 2(x^3+y^3) + (xy)^3 = 2 S(S^2-3P) + P^3$.
$P = \frac{6S^2}{25}$.
The expression becomes $2 S \left(S^2 - 3 \frac{6S^2}{25}\right) + \left(\frac{6S^2}{25}\right)^3 = \frac{14 S^3}{25} + \frac{216 S^6}{15625}$.

$S^3 = \left(\frac{5}{2^{1/3}}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{2}$
$S^6 = (S^3)^2 = \left(\frac{125}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{15625}{4}$

Value $= \frac{14}{25} \cdot \frac{125}{2} + \frac{216}{15625} \cdot \frac{15625}{4} = 35 + 54 = 89$.

"The sum of the following seven numbers is exactly 19: $a_1 = 2.56$ , $a_2 = 2.61$ , $a_3 = 2.65$ , $a_4 = 2.71$ , $a_5 = 2.79$ , $a_6 = 2.82$ , $a_7 = 2.86$ . It is desired to replace each $a_i$ by an integer approximation $A_i$ , $1\le i \le 7$ , so that the sum of the $A_i$ 's is also $19$ and so that $M$ , the maximum of the ""errors"" $\lvert A_i-a_i \rvert$ , is as small as possible. For this minimum $M$ , what is $100M$ ?",61,"Solution:
Let the given numbers be $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_7$. We are looking for integer approximations $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_7$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^7 A_i = 19$, and we want to minimize $M = \max_{1 \le i \le 7} |A_i - a_i|$.

The sum of the errors is $\sum_{i=1}^7 (A_i - a_i) = \sum_{i=1}^7 A_i - \sum_{i=1}^7 a_i = 19 - 19 = 0$.

Consider rounding each $a_i$ to the nearest integer. The nearest integers are 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. The sum is 21.
The errors for rounding to the nearest integer are $0.44, 0.39, 0.35, 0.29, 0.21, 0.18, 0.14$. The maximum error is $0.44$.

Since the sum of the nearest integers is 21, which is 2 more than the desired sum of 19, we need to decrease the sum by 2. This means changing two of the rounded integers from 3 to 2. To minimize the maximum error, we should choose the numbers where changing the rounded integer from 3 to 2 results in the smallest increase in the absolute error.

When rounding up, the errors are $1 - f_i$. The two smallest values of $1 - f_i$ are $1 - 0.86 = 0.14$ and $1 - 0.82 = 0.18$, corresponding to $a_7$ and $a_6$.
If we set $A_6 = 2$ and $A_7 = 2$, and $A_i = 3$ for $i \ne 6, 7$, the sum is 19.
The errors are $0.44, 0.39, 0.35, 0.29, 0.21, -0.82, -0.86$.
The maximum absolute error is $\max(0.44, 0.39, 0.35, 0.29, 0.21, 0.82, 0.86) = 0.86$.

Consider rounding down the numbers with the two smallest fractional parts, $a_1$ and $a_2$.
Set $A_1 = 2, A_2 = 2$, and $A_i = 3$ for $i > 2$.
Errors: $-0.56, -0.61, 0.35, 0.29, 0.21, 0.18, 0.14$.
Maximum absolute error is $\max(0.56, 0.61, 0.35, 0.29, 0.21, 0.18, 0.14) = 0.61$.

The minimum value of $M$ is $0.61$.
For this minimum $M$, $100M = 100 \times 0.61 = 61$.

"Let  $a,b,c,d,e$  be positive real numbers. Find the largest possible value for the expression  $$ \frac{ab+bc+cd+de}{2a^2+b^2+2c^2+d^2+2e^2}. $$  ","To find the largest possible value for the expression 
\[ \frac{ab+bc+cd+de}{2a^2+b^2+2c^2+d^2+2e^2}, \]
we will use the method of inequalities and optimization.

1. **Inequality Setup:**
   We start by setting up inequalities for each term in the numerator and denominator. We use the AM-GM inequality:
   \[ 2a^2 + \alpha b^2 \geq 2\sqrt{2\alpha}ab, \]
   \[ (1-\alpha)b^2 + \beta c^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(1-\alpha)\beta}bc, \]
   \[ (2-\beta)c^2 + \gamma d^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(2-\beta)\gamma}cd, \]
   \[ (1-\gamma)d^2 + 2e^2 \geq 2\sqrt{2(1-\gamma)}de. \]

2. **Parameter Constraints:**
   We need to find the values of \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) such that:
   \[ 2\alpha = (1-\alpha)\beta = (2-\beta)\gamma = 2(1-\gamma). \]

3. **Solving for \(\alpha\):**
   From the first equality:
   \[ 2\alpha = (1-\alpha)\beta. \]
   Solving for \(\beta\):
   \[ \beta = \frac{2\alpha}{1-\alpha}. \]

4. **Solving for \(\beta\):**
   From the second equality:
   \[ (1-\alpha)\beta = (2-\beta)\gamma. \]
   Substituting \(\beta\):
   \[ (1-\alpha)\left(\frac{2\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right) = (2-\frac{2\alpha}{1-\alpha})\gamma. \]
   Simplifying:
   \[ 2\alpha = \left(2 - \frac{2\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)\gamma. \]
   \[ 2\alpha = \left(\frac{2(1-\alpha) - 2\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)\gamma. \]
   \[ 2\alpha = \left(\frac{2 - 4\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)\gamma. \]
   Solving for \(\gamma\):
   \[ \gamma = \frac{2\alpha(1-\alpha)}{2 - 4\alpha}. \]

5. **Solving for \(\gamma\):**
   From the third equality:
   \[ (2-\beta)\gamma = 2(1-\gamma). \]
   Substituting \(\beta\):
   \[ (2 - \frac{2\alpha}{1-\alpha})\gamma = 2(1-\gamma). \]
   Simplifying:
   \[ \left(\frac{2(1-\alpha) - 2\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)\gamma = 2(1-\gamma). \]
   \[ \left(\frac{2 - 4\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)\gamma = 2(1-\gamma). \]
   Solving for \(\gamma\):
   \[ \gamma = \frac{2(1-\gamma)(1-\alpha)}{2 - 4\alpha}. \]

6. **Finding \(\alpha\):**
   Solving the system of equations, we find:
   \[ \alpha = \frac{1}{3}. \]

7. **Verification:**
   Substituting \(\alpha = \frac{1}{3}\) into the inequalities, we verify that equality holds:
   \[ 2a^2 + \frac{1}{3}b^2 \geq 2\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}ab, \]
   \[ \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)b^2 + \beta c^2 \geq 2\sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\beta}bc, \]
   \[ \left(2 - \beta\right)c^2 + \gamma d^2 \geq 2\sqrt{\left(2 - \beta\right)\gamma}cd, \]
   \[ \left(1 - \gamma\right)d^2 + 2e^2 \geq 2\sqrt{2\left(1 - \gamma\right)}de. \]

8. **Final Calculation:**
   The largest value is:
   \[ \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{8}}. \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{3}{8}}}\).","Solution:
Let the expression be denoted by $E$. We want to find the largest possible value for
$$ E = \frac{ab+bc+cd+de}{2a^2+b^2+2c^2+d^2+2e^2}. $$
Let the maximum value be $\lambda$. Then $ab+bc+cd+de \le \lambda (2a^2+b^2+2c^2+d^2+2e^2)$.
Rearranging, $2\lambda a^2 - ab + \lambda b^2 - bc + 2\lambda c^2 - cd + \lambda d^2 - de + 2\lambda e^2 \ge 0$.
Consider the quadratic form $Q(a,b,c,d,e) = 2\lambda a^2 - ab + \lambda b^2 - bc + 2\lambda c^2 - cd + \lambda d^2 - de + 2\lambda e^2$.
The associated symmetric matrix is
$$ M = \begin{pmatrix} 2\lambda & -1/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1/2 & \lambda & -1/2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1/2 & 2\lambda & -1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1/2 & \lambda & -1/2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1/2 & 2\lambda \end{pmatrix}. $$
For the quadratic form to be non-negative, the matrix must be positive semi-definite.

Consider the case where the maximum is attained, so $ab+bc+cd+de = \lambda (2a^2+b^2+2c^2+d^2+2e^2)$.
This is equivalent to the existence of a non-zero vector $(a,b,c,d,e)$ such that $Q(a,b,c,d,e) = 0$.
This occurs when the determinant of the matrix $M$ is zero.
The determinant is given by $64\lambda^4 - 32\lambda^2 + 3 = 0$.
Let $x = \lambda^2$. Then $64x^2 - 32x + 3 = 0$.
The roots are $x = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{32^2 - 4(64)(3)}}{128} = \frac{32 \pm 16}{128}$, so $x = 3/8$ or $x = 1/8$.
The possible values for $\lambda$ are $\sqrt{3/8} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\sqrt{1/8} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$.
The largest possible value is $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}$.

"Enya and John are of normal phenotype but they have a son with a genetic condition that is caused by a mutation in the DMD gene and is a sex-linked recessive disorder. What are the chances of having a carrier and diseased child with each pregnancy if the sex of the child is unknown and there were no epigenetic changes involved in the progression of the disease?
Answer Choices:
(A) 50% carrier and 50% diseased
(B) 100% carrier and 50% diseased
(C) 25% carrier and 25% diseased
(D) 50% carrier and 25% diseased","25% carrier and 25% diseased is the right choice. In a sex-linked recessive disorder, there is a 50% chance of having a carrier daughter and a 50% chance of having a diseased son. As the sex of the child is unknown, so chances are further decreased by 50%. There is a 50% chance that the child will be a male and another 50% chance that he may be normal or diseased. Let me explain it with an example. Let a couple have 4 children, 2 males, and 2 females. The female is a carrier of the sex-linked recessive disorder. In 2 females children one is normal and the other one is carrier. So the chances of the carrier a female child are ¼ which is 25%.

Answer: C","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Determine the parents' genotypes:**

* **Son with the disease:** Since the condition is sex-linked recessive, the son (XY) must have received the recessive allele (let's denote it as 'd') on his X chromosome from his mother. So, his genotype is X<sup>d</sup>Y.
* **Father with normal phenotype:**  A male with a normal phenotype for a sex-linked recessive trait must have the dominant allele (let's denote it as 'D') on his X chromosome. His genotype is X<sup>D</sup>Y.
* **Mother with normal phenotype:**  Since her son inherited the recessive allele, she must be carrying it. Because she has a normal phenotype, she must also have the dominant allele. Therefore, her genotype is X<sup>D</sup>X<sup>d</sup> (a carrier).

**2. Set up a Punnett square to predict the offspring genotypes:**

|       | X<sup>D</sup>  | Y      |
|-------|----------|--------|
| X<sup>D</sup> | X<sup>D</sup>X<sup>D</sup> | X<sup>D</sup>Y  |
| X<sup>d</sup> | X<sup>D</sup>X<sup>d</sup> | X<sup>d</sup>Y  |

**3. Analyze the possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes:**

* **X<sup>D</sup>X<sup>D</sup>:** Female, normal phenotype (non-carrier)
* **X<sup>D</sup>Y:** Male, normal phenotype
* **X<sup>D</sup>X<sup>d</sup>:** Female, normal phenotype (carrier)
* **X<sup>d</sup>Y:** Male, diseased

**4. Calculate the probabilities for each outcome, considering the unknown sex of the child:**

Out of the four equally likely possibilities:

* **Carrier child (X<sup>D</sup>X<sup>d</sup>):** 1 out of 4 possibilities = 25%
* **Diseased child (X<sup>d</sup>Y):** 1 out of 4 possibilities = 25%

**Therefore, the chances of having a carrier child is 25% and the chances of having a diseased child is 25% with each pregnancy.**

**The correct answer is (C) 25% carrier and 25% diseased.**

"In the game of *Ring Mafia*, there are  $2019$  counters arranged in a circle.  $673$  of these counters are mafia, and the remaining  $1346$  counters are town. Two players, Tony and Madeline, take turns with Tony going first. Tony does not know which counters are mafia but Madeline does. 

On Tony’s turn, he selects any subset of the counters (possibly the empty set) and removes all counters in that set. On Madeline’s turn, she selects a town counter which is adjacent to a mafia counter and removes it. Whenever counters are removed, the remaining counters are brought closer together without changing their order so that they still form a circle. The game ends when either all mafia counters have been removed, or all town counters have been removed.

Is there a strategy for Tony that guarantees, no matter where the mafia counters are placed and what Madeline does, that at least one town counter remains at the end of the game?

*Proposed by Andrew Gu*","1. **Restate the problem and initial conditions:**
   - There are 2019 counters arranged in a circle.
   - 673 of these counters are mafia, and the remaining 1346 counters are town.
   - Tony and Madeline take turns, with Tony going first.
   - Tony can remove any subset of counters on his turn.
   - Madeline removes a town counter adjacent to a mafia counter on her turn.
   - The game ends when either all mafia counters or all town counters are removed.
   - The goal is to determine if Tony has a strategy that guarantees at least one town counter remains at the end of the game.

2. **Claim:**
   - If Madeline can win the game from a certain position, she can also win if some mafia counters are added and/or some town counters are deleted from the initial position.

3. **Proof of the Claim:**
   - If a mafia counter is added, Madeline can pretend it does not exist. If Tony selects it, she can ignore it.
   - Adding a mafia counter does not limit which counters she can take away since she can take away the counters on both sides of the mafia.
   - If a town counter is deleted, Madeline can pretend it still exists and play accordingly.
   - Deleting a town counter does not limit the counters she can take away for the same reason as above.

4. **Induction Hypothesis:**
   - Let \( P(n) \) be the assertion that Tony cannot deploy a successful strategy if there are \( 2n \) town counters and \( n \) mafia counters.

5. **Base Case:**
   - For \( P(1) \), we have 2 town counters and 1 mafia counter.
   - If Tony does not remove any counter, Madeline removes both town counters.
   - If Tony removes one counter, Madeline can arrange the counters so that Tony removes a town counter, and she removes the remaining town counter.
   - If Tony removes more than one counter, Madeline can arrange the counters so that he removes both town counters.
   - Thus, \( P(1) \) is true.

6. **Inductive Step:**
   - Assume \( P(k-1) \) is true. We wish to show \( P(k) \) is true.
   - If Tony's first move is to remove \( m \neq 0 \) counters, Madeline can arrange the counters such that all \( m \) counters are town counters.
   - If \( m = 1 \), Madeline removes a town counter and then the adjacent mafia counter.
   - If \( m > 1 \), Madeline can add back \( m-1 \) town counters and repeat the \( m = 1 \) case.
   - In both cases, the game reduces to \( P(k-1) \), which is true by induction.

7. **Case when Tony does not remove any counters:**
   - Madeline arranges the counters such that there exists a triplet \( T = (a, b, c) \) where \( b \) is a town counter, and \( \{a, c\} \) contains one town and one mafia counter.
   - Madeline removes \( b \). The counters \( a \) and \( c \) are now adjacent.
   - If Tony chooses any counters other than \( a \) or \( c \), Madeline rearranges the counters such that all selected counters are towns and adds back that many town counters.
   - If Tony did not choose either \( a \) or \( c \), Madeline removes both \( a \) and \( c \).
   - If Tony chose \( a \) but not \( c \), set \( a \) as the town and delete \( c \).
   - If Tony chose \( c \) but not \( a \), set \( c \) as the town and delete \( a \).
   - If Tony chose both, the problem reduces to \( P(k-1) \).

8. **Conclusion:**
   - By induction, Tony cannot guarantee that at least one town counter remains at the end of the game.

The final answer is \(\boxed{\text{no}}\).","Solution:
Let $M$ be the number of mafia counters and $T$ be the number of town counters.
Initially, $M = 673$ and $T = 1346$.

Consider the strategy for Tony where in each of his turns, he removes a single counter.

Case 1: Tony removes a mafia counter.
The number of mafia counters becomes $M-1$, and the number of town counters remains $T$.

Case 2: Tony removes a town counter.
The number of mafia counters remains $M$, and the number of town counters becomes $T-1$.
On Madeline's turn, she removes a town counter adjacent to a mafia counter. The number of mafia counters remains $M$, and the number of town counters becomes $T-2$.

Consider the strategy for Tony: In each of his turns, remove a single counter.

If Tony always removes a town counter, then after his $k$-th turn, $k$ town counters are removed. Then Madeline removes $k$ town counters.

Consider the total number of town counters, $T=1346$. If Tony always removes a town counter, after 673 turns, Tony removes 673 town counters. Then Madeline removes 673 town counters. Total $673+673 = 1346$ town counters removed. If the game doesn't end before this, all town counters are removed, and Madeline wins.

Consider the strategy for Tony: Remove a single counter in each turn.
If Tony removes a mafia counter, this helps his goal of removing all mafia.
If Tony removes a town counter, Madeline removes a town counter.

Consider the state of the game as $(m, t)$, where $m$ is the number of mafia counters and $t$ is the number of town counters.
Initially, $(673, 1346)$.

If Tony removes a mafia, the state becomes $(672, 1346)$.
If Tony removes a town, the state becomes $(673, 1345)$. Then Madeline removes a town, $(673, 1344)$.

Consider the strategy: Tony removes a single counter in each turn.
If Tony removes a mafia, good for Tony.
If Tony removes a town, Madeline removes a town.

Consider the number of town counters. If Tony removes a town, and then Madeline removes a town, the number of town counters decreases by 2 in a pair of turns.

   x_6 + x_7 > 0.9N \implies x_7 > 0.9N - x_6
   \]

9. Combining these inequalities:
   \[
   x_7 > 0.9N - x_5 \quad \text{and} \quad x_7 > 0.9N - x_6
   \]

10. Since \( x_7 \) must satisfy both conditions, we take the more restrictive one:
    \[
    x_7 > 0.9N - \max(x_5, x_6)
    \]

11. To prove \( \frac{x_7}{x_6 + x_7} > 0.9 \), we start with:
    \[
    x_7 > 0.9(x_6 + x_7)
    \]

12. Rearrange the inequality:
    \[
    x_7 > 0.9x_6 + 0.9x_7
    \]

13. Subtract \( 0.9x_7 \) from both sides:
    \[
    0.1x_7 > 0.9x_6
    \]

14. Divide both sides by \( 0.1 \):
    \[
    x_7 > 9x_6
    \]

15. Since \( x_7 > 0.9N - x_6 \), and \( x_6 \) is a small fraction of \( N \), it follows that \( x_7 \) is significantly larger than \( x_6 \).

16. Therefore, the ratio \( \frac{x_7}{x_6 + x_7} \) is dominated by \( x_7 \), making it greater than \( 0.9 \).

\[
\boxed{\frac{x_7}{x_6 + x_7} > 0.9}
\]","Solution:
Let $N$ be the total number of students in the school. Let $E$ be the set of students who know English, $G$ be the set of students who know German, and $F$ be the set of students who know French.

We are given:
1. $|E \cap G| > 0.90 N$
2. $|E \cap F| > 0.90 N$

We need to prove that more than $90\%$ of the students who know both German and French also know English. This means we need to show that $\frac{|E \cap G \cap F|}{|G \cap F|} > 0.90$.

Consider the number of students who know German and French but not English. This is $|G \cap F \cap E^c|$.
We have $G \cap F \cap E^c = (G \cap E^c) \cap F$.

The number of students who do not know English or do not know German is $|E^c \cup G^c| = N - |E \cap G| < N - 0.90 N = 0.10 N$.
The number of students who do not know English or do not know French is $|E^c \cup F^c| = N - |E \cap F| < N - 0.90 N = 0.10 N$.

Consider the number of students who know German and French but not English. These are students who know German, know French, and do not know English. This is the set $G \cap F \cap E^c$.
We know that $G \cap F \cap E^c \subseteq E^c$.
Also, $G \cap F \cap E^c \subseteq G \cap E^c$ and $G \cap F \cap E^c \subseteq F \cap E^c$.

The number of students who know German but not English is $|G \setminus E| = |G \cap E^c|$.
Since $G \cap E^c \subseteq E^c \cup G^c$, we have $|G \cap E^c| \le |E^c \cup G^c| < 0.10 N$.
The number of students who know French but not English is $|F \setminus E| = |F \cap E^c|$.
Since $F \cap E^c \subseteq E^c \cup F^c$, we have $|F \cap E^c| \le |E^c \cup F^c| < 0.10 N$.

Consider the number of students who know German and French but not English, $|G \cap F \cap E^c|$.
Since $G \cap F \cap E^c \subseteq G \cap E^c$, we have $|G \cap F \cap E^c| \le |G \cap E^c| < 0.10 N$.

The number of students who know both German and French is $|G \cap F|$.
We have $|G \cap F| = N - |G^c \cup F^c| = N - (|G^c| + |F^c| - |G^c \cap F^c|)$.
We know $|G^c| = N - |G|$, $|F^c| = N - |F|$.

The number of students who know German and French but not English is $|(G \cap F) \setminus E|$.
We have shown that $|G \cap F \cap E^c| < 0.10 N$.

The proportion of students who know German and French but not English among those who know German and French is $\frac{|G \cap F \cap E^c|}{|G \cap F|}$.
We know $|G \cap F \cap E^c| < 0.10 N$.
Also, $|G \cap F| = N - |G^c \cup F^c| \ge N - (|G^c| + |F^c|) = N - ((N - |G|) + (N - |F|)) = |G| + |F| - N$.
Since $|E \cap G| > 0.90 N$, $|G| > 0.90 N$. Similarly, $|F| > 0.90 N$.
$|G \cap F| > 0.90 N + 0.90 N - N = 0.80 N$.

So, $\frac{|G \cap F \cap E^c|}{|G \cap F|} < \frac{0.10 N}{0.80 N} = 0.125$.

The proportion of students who know both German and French and also know English is $1 - \frac{|G \cap F \cap E^c|}{|G \cap F|} > 1 - 0.125 = 0.875$. This is not $> 0.90$.

"9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?
Answer Choices:
(A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
(B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
(C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
(D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride","The product must be a carbonyl fluoride, since +29.8 ppm is extremely deshielded, much too deshielded to be an aryl fluoride.

of the two carbonyl fluoride products, 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride must be the correct one, since the C-F bond that has formed is on the same carbon whose C-C bond was cleaved to form the carbonyl fluoride.

Answer: B","Let's analyze the <sup>19</sup>F NMR data and the reactants to determine the product.

* **<sup>19</sup>F NMR Signals:** The two distinct signals indicate that the product contains two fluorine atoms in different chemical environments.
    * **+29.8 ppm:** This is a highly deshielded fluorine signal. Fluorine atoms attached to carbonyl groups (acyl fluorides) typically appear in this downfield region.
    * **-115.7 ppm:** This is a more typical chemical shift for a fluorine atom directly bonded to an aromatic ring.

* **Reactants:**
    * **9-fluorenone:** A ketone with a planar structure.
    * **Selectfluor (2 equivalents):** A source of electrophilic fluorine.
    * **Acetonitrile:** A polar aprotic solvent, often used in reactions with Selectfluor.
    * **400nm light:**  Indicates a photochemical reaction, which can promote radical formation or excite molecules.

Now let's evaluate the answer choices:

**(A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one:** This product would have two fluorine atoms directly attached to the aromatic rings of the fluorenone. While the chemical shifts of aryl fluorides can vary, it's unlikely that one would be as far downfield as +29.8 ppm. Both fluorine signals would likely be in a similar, more negative range.

**(B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride:** This product suggests a bond cleavage in the 9-fluorenone structure, leading to a biphenyl derivative. The ""carbonyl fluoride"" part explains the +29.8 ppm signal, as fluorine directly attached to a carbonyl carbon is highly deshielded. The ""2'-fluoro"" part indicates a fluorine on one of the phenyl rings, which would account for the -115.7 ppm signal. This option aligns well with the <sup>19</sup>F NMR data.

**(C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one:** Similar to option (A), this product has two fluorine atoms directly on the aromatic rings. The same reasoning against option (A) applies here regarding the unlikely downfield shift of one fluorine.

**(D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride:** This option also involves bond cleavage and the formation of a carbonyl fluoride and an aryl fluoride. The <sup>19</sup>F NMR data is consistent with this structure as well.

**Distinguishing between (B) and (D):**

The key is to consider the likely mechanism of the reaction. The photochemical conditions suggest a possible radical pathway or excitation of the 9-fluorenone. The formation of a carbonyl fluoride is a crucial piece of evidence. This likely arises from the attack of a fluorine species (possibly a radical generated from Selectfluor under irradiation) on the carbonyl carbon, followed by further reaction.

Considering the starting material, 9-fluorenone, the numbering system for the biphenyl formed after bond cleavage would originate from the original structure. The ""2-carbonyl"" designation in both (B) and (D) indicates that the carbonyl group (now fluorinated) was originally at the 9-position of the fluorenone. When the central bond breaks, this carbonyl-containing ring becomes one of the phenyl rings in the biphenyl, with the carbonyl group at the 2-position relative to the inter-ring bond.

The difference lies in the position of the other fluorine atom on the *other* phenyl ring. Without further information about the regioselectivity of the fluorination, it's difficult to definitively choose between (B) and (D) based solely on the <sup>19</sup>F NMR. However, the standard convention in naming biphenyl derivatives formed from substituted benzenes often keeps the numbering consistent with the starting material's substitution pattern.

Given the formation of the carbonyl fluoride, the most direct pathway likely involves an attack on the carbonyl group. The other fluorine atom would then attach to the adjacent phenyl ring.

**Therefore, based on the <sup>19</sup>F NMR data strongly suggesting a carbonyl fluoride and an aryl fluoride, and considering the likely mechanism involving the carbonyl group, the most probable product is (B).**

"Three of the edges of a cube are $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC},$ and $\overline{CD},$ and $\overline{AD}$ is an interior diagonal .  Points $P, Q,$ and $R$ are on $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC},$ and $\overline{CD},$ respectively, so that $AP = 5, PB = 15, BQ = 15,$ and $CR = 10.$ What is the area of the polygon that is the intersection of plane $PQR$ and the cube?",525,"Solution:
Let the cube have one vertex at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ and edges along the positive axes. Based on the given edges $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}, \overline{CD}$ and the interior diagonal $\overline{AD}$, we can place the vertices as $B=(0,0,0), A=(20,0,0), C=(0,20,0), D=(0,20,20)$. The side length of the cube is $20$.

The points $P, Q, R$ are $P(15, 0, 0), Q(0, 15, 0), R(0, 20, 10)$.
The plane $PQR$ has the equation $2x + 2y - z = 30$.

The intersection of the plane with the faces of the cube forms a hexagon with vertices $P(15, 0, 0), Q(0, 15, 0), R(0, 20, 10), U(5, 20, 20), T(20, 5, 20), S(20, 0, 10)$.

To find the area of this hexagon, we project it onto one of the coordinate planes, say the $xy$-plane. The projection has vertices $P'(15, 0), Q'(0, 15), R'(0, 20), U'(5, 20), T'(20, 5), S'(20, 0)$.

Using the shoelace formula for the area of the projected hexagon:
Area = $\frac{1}{2} | (15 \cdot 15 + 0 \cdot 20 + 0 \cdot 20 + 5 \cdot 5 + 20 \cdot 0 + 20 \cdot 0) - (0 \cdot 0 + 15 \cdot 0 + 20 \cdot 5 + 20 \cdot 20 + 5 \cdot 20 + 0 \cdot 15) |$
Area = $\frac{1}{2} | (225 + 0 + 0 + 25 + 0 + 0) - (0 + 0 + 100 + 400 + 100 + 0) |$
Area = $\frac{1}{2} | 250 - 600 | = \frac{1}{2} |-350| = 175$.

The area of the projection is related to the area of the polygon by a factor involving the normal vector of the plane. The normal vector is $\vec{n} = (2, 2, -1)$, and its magnitude is $|\vec{n}| = 3$. The cosine of the angle between the normal vector and the z-axis is $\frac{|-1|}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Area of projection = Area of polygon $\times |\cos \gamma|$
$175 = \text{Area of polygon} \times \frac{1}{3}$
Area of the polygon = $175 \times 3 = 525$.
